										How To Use The Target Lead Indicator
*******************************************************************************************************************************

All settings for the Target Lead Indicator can be found "FX_3DRadar_Mgr" --> "HUD Dispaly Settings" --> "Target Lead Indicator Settings"

When the Target Lead Indicator is enabled it will display a point where the player needs to shoot in ordre to hit a target.
To do this the Target Lead Indicator needs a few things first.
1. Player Velocity "Auto Calculated"
2. Target Velocity "Auto Calculated"
3. Players Projectile Velocity "FX_3DRadar_Mgr.ProjectileVelocity"

Both the Player & Targets velocity will be automatically calculated using one of two methods. 
Method 1. If "Use Player / Target Physics" is selected in the "Target Lead Indicator Settings" then the velocity will be determined 
via Rigidbodies attached to the Player / Target.

Method 2. If "Use Player / Target Physics" is not selected the the velocity will be calculated per frame based on how far the Player / Target
moved from the previous frame.

Next the Target Lead Indicator needs to know how fast the projectile is that will be fired at the target.
This can be done in one of two ways.

Method 1. Pre-set the projectile velocity into "Projectile Velocity" field. This is good if you know your projectile speed and it will never change.

Method 2. Update the Projectile Velocity during runtime from an external script "FX_3DRadar_Mgr.ProjectileVelocity = My Projectile Speed;" This is a Float Value.
This is not a static var so you will need a refrence to the "FX_3DRadar_Mgr.cs" script.
This method is good if you have multiple weapons with different speeds that the player can switch between, or you need fine controll such as usign the average speed of a fire group.

If a Projectile Velocity is not provided the Target Lead Indicator will appear to center over the target.
